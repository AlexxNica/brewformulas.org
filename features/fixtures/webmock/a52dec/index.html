<h2>News</h2>

<p>July 27, 2002: a52dec-0.7.4 is
<a href="files/a52dec-0.7.4.tar.gz">released</a> ! With full
reentrancy, win32 output, al file output, gain control, and a few
portability fixes.</p>

<p>February 20, 2002: a52dec-0.7.3 is
<a href="files/a52dec-0.7.3.tar.gz">released</a> ! With 40% to 80%
improved speed, some bugfixes, and a few new output modules.</p>

<p>December 16, 2001: a52dec-0.7.2 is
<a href="/files/a52dec-0.7.2.tar.gz">released</a> ! This release adds
wav format output, and an improved demuxer which makes it easier to
use a52dec as a pipe. Also, lots of minor bugfixes and
performance/portability enhancements.</p>

<h2>About liba52</h2>

<p><b>liba52</b> is a free library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams. It is
released under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> license. The A/52
standard is used in a variety of applications, including digital television
and DVD. It is also known as AC-3.</p>

<p>The main goals in liba52 development are:</p>
<ul><li><b>Portability</b> - Currently all of the code is written in
	C, and when we write platform-specific optimizations we will
	always keep a generic C routine to fall back on.</li>
    <li><b>Reuseability</b> - we do not want liba52 to include any
	project-specific code, but it should still include enough features
	to be used by very diverse projects.</li>
    <li><b>Precision</b> - We are trying to implement all of the A/52
	standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the
	calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that detects
	any deviation in the output when compared to previous versions.
	We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors though, so
	we have to use our judgement to ensure that such deviations are
	only intruduced when we fix bugs !</li>
    <li><b>Speed</b> - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should
	take only a few percent of CPU time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project homepage is at <a href="http://liba52.sourceforge.net/">http://liba52.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<h2>a52dec</h2>

<p><b>a52dec</b> is a test program for liba52. It decodes ATSC A/52 streams,
and also includes a demultiplexer for mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 program streams.</p>

<p>The liba52 source code is always distributed in the a52dec package,
to make sure it easier for people to test it.</p>

<h2>Other projects using liba52</h2>

<p>liba52 (and its ancestor libac3) is being used by various other projects,
including:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://xine.sourceforge.net/">xine</a>  - started as a simple
	mpeg-2 audio and video decoder, but it since became a full-featured
	DVD and video media player.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.videolan.org">VideoLAN</a> - video
	streaming over an ethernet network, can also be used as a
	standalone player.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.MPlayerHQ.hu">MPlayer</a> - another good
	player, it is also very robust against damaged streams.</li>
    <li><a href="http://movietime.sourceforge.net/">movietime</a> - still
	quite young, but it looks very promising !</li>
    <li><a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/">ffmpeg</a> - a nice
	audio/video encoder and transcoder, uses liba52 for decoding A/52
	streams.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/">Ogle</a> - a
	good DVD player with menu support.</li>
    <li><a href="http://tcvp.sf.net">TCVP</a> - video and music player
	for unix.</li>
    <li><a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/~toku/software_en.html">a52decX</a>
	- a graphical interface for a52dec for macintosh osX.</li>
    <li><a href="http://denisx.dyndns.org/bd4go/">bd4go</a> - another
	graphical interface for macintosh osX.</li>
    <li><a href="http://drip.sourceforge.net/">drip</a> - a DVD to
	DIVX transcoder.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.linuxvideo.org/oms/">OMS</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://xmps.sourceforge.net/">XMPS</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.gstreamer.net/">GStreamer</a> - a framework for
	streaming media; it has an A/52 decoding plugin based on liba52.</li>
    <li><a href="http://mpeglib.sourceforge.net/">mpeglib</a> - a video
	decoding library that usess liba52 when decoding A/52 streams.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use liba52 in another project, let us know !</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>There are several places where we could easily use some help:</p>
<ul><li><b>Web design</b>: This site sucks ! at the very least, we'd like to
	come up with a nicer background picture and a logo.</li>
    <li><b>Testing</b>: If you find any stream that does not decode right with
	liba52, let us know ! The best thing would be to mail to the
	liba52-devel mailing list. Also if you have access to encoders,
	we'd love to get test streams that would be free of rights -
	so that we can put them on this server.</li>
    <li><b>Coding</b>: There is a small TODO list in the a52dec package,
	you can have a look there !</li>
    <li><b>Porting</b>: If you're porting to a new architecture, you might want
	to experiment with the compile flags defined in configure.in . When
	you figure out whats fastest on your platform, send us a patch !</li>
</ul>
